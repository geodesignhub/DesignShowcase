# Geodesignhub Design Showcase
This plugin uses the [Geodesignhub API](https://www.geodesignhub.com/api) to download information about a design and analyze it to produce a showcase that shows important information about the design. 

### Motivation
A Design synthesis in Geodesignhub is a combination of different ideas that are often negotiated. Negotiations happen very fast and it is important to have deeper sense of the design and it's components. Comparisons can be made in a few different ways as is shown below.

### Adding your project
This plugin can be added to your project in the Administration interface. 

### Details
At this stage the "Taxonomy" and "Geographical" comparison can be made. 

Taxonomy / Semiotic analysis: We perform Natural lanugage processing and analysis on the names of diagrams and form a similiarity index to then show a graph of the different connections. 

Conceptual / Ideology: The software uses Python Natural language processing to build a world cloud of the different ideas for a place. 

Topological comparisons: To be implemented

Geographical Comparison: To be implemented. Although Geodesignhub provides a very good geographical comparison tools.
